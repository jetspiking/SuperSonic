SuperSonic is a YouTubeExplode implementation for educational purposes.

# Description
SuperSonic is an educational implementation based on [YouTubeExplode](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode). The project is based on and inspired by the corresponding example Demo.GUI project. However, some changes were made for a more minimalistic interface.

This project provides an example implementation for the YouTubeExplode package and is published for educational purposes only.

The project also contains a configuration to demonstrate building self-contained and standalone binaries. The binaries are included for reference purposes.

# Thank you for using SuperSonic
